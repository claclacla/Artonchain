# Artonchain

Artonchain is my personal project to bring my artwork on-chain as NFTs while I learn Web3. This repository serves as my learning journey into blockchain development, smart contracts, and the NFT ecosystem.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/claclacla/Artonchain.git
   cd Artonchain
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   forge install
   ```

3. **Build and test**
   ```bash
   forge build
   forge test
   ```

## Blockchain Infrastructure

### Sepolia ðŸ§ª
**Sepolia** is a testnet (test network) for Ethereum:
- **Purpose**: A testing environment that mimics the real Ethereum network
- **Free**: Uses "fake" ETH that has no real value
- **Safe**: Perfect for testing smart contracts before deploying to mainnet
- **Why use it**: Deploy and test your contracts without spending real money

### Infura & Alchemy ðŸ”—
**Infura** and **Alchemy** are blockchain infrastructure providers:
- **What they do**: Provide reliable RPC endpoints to connect to Ethereum networks
- **RPC Endpoint**: A URL that lets your app communicate with the blockchain
- **Why use them**: Instead of running your own Ethereum node (expensive/complex), you use their infrastructure
- **Services**: Offer access to Ethereum, IPFS, and other blockchain networks

**Example RPC URLs:**
- Infura: `https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID`
- Alchemy: `https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY`

## Deployment

Deploy your Artonchain NFT contract to Sepolia testnet:

1. **Set environment variables**
   ```bash
   export SEPOLIA_RPC_URL="your_sepolia_rpc_url_here"
   export PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key_here"
   ```

2. **Deploy to Sepolia**
   ```bash
   forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url sepolia --broadcast --verify
   ```

## Project Goals

- **Daily Learning**: Consistent progress in Web3 development
- **NFT Experimentation**: Exploring different NFT standards and features
- **Building in Public**: Sharing my journey and learning process
